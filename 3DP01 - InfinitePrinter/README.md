INFINITE 3D PRINTER
*********************************************************************************

Ever since the 3D printing technology was invented, everyone was so fascinated
about it. From reducing costs to increasing efficiency to spurring innovation, many
people are excited about the impact that 3D printing will have on the future of
manufacturing. However, the truth is, it already has made a significant impact on the
industry.

It has been inspirational to see the evolution of 3D printing and to see manufacturers
across all industries work together to shape the industry and economy. However, the
capabilities of 3D printing are limited due to various reasons, one of them is the
restrictions on the build volume. The variety of products that can be printed are
limited by these constraints.

The infinite 3D printer has an ability of printing infinitely in one or more directions,
thereby, making the printer more usable to print a wide variety of parts, of any length.
Usage of a conveyor belt as the bed rather than a static bed reduces the manual
effort needed and increases the production rate.

Our project is to build an infinite printer which is low cost and efficient. Two models,
of similar kinds of projects, are used for reference in building our printer. Detailed
analysis, of all parts of the printer, is done for both the models and the modified
features are included in our build.
