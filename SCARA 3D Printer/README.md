### Description

The Selective Compliance Assembly Robotic Arm (Scara) is a very precise system with a tiny footprint. A Scara 3D printer looks and moves much like an industrial robot on a car assembly line. SCARA is good even in deposition tasks due to its primary job of installing electrical components over circuit boards.

## About the Project

We aim to build a working SCARA 3D Printing bot. Currently focused at two builds. Detailed analysis, of all parts of the printer, is done for both the models and the features are included in our build.

### Hardware Fundamentals

In our project, the arm is slightly compliant in the X-Y direction but rigid in the 'Z' direction. The second attribute of the SCARA is the jointed two-link arm layout similar to our human arms.

This feature allows the arm to extend into confined areas and then retract or "fold up" out of the way.

### Software Power

The base firmware is Marlin, with little tweaks and practical parameters, coded on __*ARDUINO*__.
